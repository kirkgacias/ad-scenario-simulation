<h1>Scenarios</h1>

<h3>&#9312; User Account Creation </h3>

<h4>Background:</h4>

<p>A new software developer, John Smith, has been hired to join the IT department at your company. As part of the onboarding process, the IT help desk needs to create a new user account for John in Active Directory.</p>

<p><strong>First create a new user account named "John Smith" with the username "john_smith" and a temporary password.</strong></p>

<img width="324" alt="john smith" src="https://github.com/kirkgacias/ad-scenario-simulation/assets/158519921/1a695e10-9cb3-4013-bd48-0ed2b9f3c31d">

<p><strong>NOTE: Set the account to require a password change at the next login.</strong></p>


<p><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>.</strong></p>

<p><strong> Assign John to the "Developers" security group in Active Directory.</strong></p>

<img width="340" alt="developers" src="https://github.com/kirkgacias/ad-scenario-simulation/assets/158519921/a1f6ef6a-5c02-41c5-a331-eddde3b2e0f0">

<p><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>.</strong></p>


<p><strong>Then ensure that John's account is located in the appropriate Organizational Unit (OU) for IT staff.</strong></p>
